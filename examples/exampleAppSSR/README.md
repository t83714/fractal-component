# Server-side Rendering (SSR) example app

## Overview
This example App has similar functionalities as [exampleApp](../exampleApp) except:
- Render all component at server-side and output render result (HTML, CSS & redux store snapshot) to client
- At server side, sent actions to trigger the initial Random Gif image url loading

Thanks to the built-in namespace system. `fractal-component` can guarantee that the CSS class names generated by [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss) are always consistent. Therefore, we don't need to worry about the className mismatch between SSR and hydrated issue with React 16 (see [this](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/8522) & [this](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/issues/677))

1. Clone this repository
